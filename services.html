    <p class="ps1">Using a dedicated line reduces the risk of leakage associated with multiple connections

        Integrated anti-siphon valve and anti-reflux valve prevent free flow and back flow
        
        Wide bore IV gravity line enables high fluid flow to ensure continuous infusion
        
        Minimal dead space designed to help prevent potential overdose in cases of accidental bolus
        
        Micro bore tubing to prevent kinking and occlusion
        
        Siamese tubing on double and triple infusion lines to prevent entanglement</p>

    <h1 class="ha2">Progressive Gynacology</h1>
    <p class="ps2">For over 30 years Mediplus has manufactured a gold standard range of catheters and accessories designed to enhance safety and comfort during urodynamic procedures.


        The Mediplus urodynamic range was developed in conjunction with clinicians to ensure optimum performance and ease of use.
        
        
        Mediplus catheters offer a wide range of benefits including:
        
        
        Colour coded for ease of identification
        
        
        Integrated extension sets to reduce the number of connections, thereby reducing inventory and lowering costs
        
        
        Ergonomically designed with winged luer locks for optimum grip and secure connection to transducers
        
        
        Specific lumen split reduces the size of the catheter whilst maintaining filling rates
        
        
        Smooth ‘eyes’ reduce discomfort when inserting and removing the catheter</p>
    <img src="logo 1/operate.jpg" class="pic3">
    <h1 class="ha3">Operating Room</h1>
    <p class="ps3">Surgical Loops

        The Surgical Loops are specially designed to help identify and retract vessels during surgical procedures.  
        
        
        The Loops are made from Silicone Elastomer and are ideal for temporary ligation, occlusion and identification of vessels and structures.</p>
