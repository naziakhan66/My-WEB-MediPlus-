        <p class="p9"> Baseline Data
            Our Scope 1 baseline emissions were calculated by collating usage data for natural gas and electricity. Our Scope 2 baseline data is collated from data on the use of private vehicles driven on company business. Moving forward this reporting will be further developed to include air and train travel. Our Scope 3 baseline will be set at a later date as this is a complex data set that will require additional resource and a project group to work on. Conversion factors used for calculating CO2e are taken from government conversion factors for company reporting of greenhouse gas emissions  </p>
